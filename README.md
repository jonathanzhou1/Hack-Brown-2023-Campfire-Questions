Hack@Brown 2023 Project: Campfire Questions

Imagine you’re sitting in a class with hundreds of other students. You have a question, but you’re not sure if you should ask it. What if it’s a redundant question? Are you bothering other students if you ask? These are some of the common questions that can plague students with anxiety whenever they might have a question! Campfire Questions can solve this problem.
